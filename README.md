# Tea Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview

Tea Leaf Disease Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying diseases in tea leaves using image classification techniques. The project leverages deep learning algorithms to analyze images of tea leaves and detect signs of diseases, allowing for early intervention and effective disease management in tea plantations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the Tea Leaf Disease Detection model consists of labeled examples of tea leaf images, with each image annotated to indicate the presence or absence of diseases. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## Algorithms Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning (e.g., using pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet)

## Usage

To use the Tea Leaf Disease Detection model:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/VIGNESH-PROJECTWORK/tealeaf-disease.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd tealeaf-disease

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

   python tealeaf_disease_detection.py

   Follow the instructions provided to input a tea leaf image and see the model's classification result.

## Results

The performance of the Tea Leaf Disease Detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are presented in the project report along with visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness in detecting and classifying tea leaf diseases.
